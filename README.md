# MovieRecommenderForDummies
ESE 527 Project

(Following assumes all packages and Python 3 installed and python added to PATH)
### Steps in order to run Movie Recommendation Engine:
1) Clone repository
2) Unzip csvs in include/
3) Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in order to install the necessary libraries (Note: This installation may not be all encompassing and some niche libraries may be left out if so pip install according to error messages.  Additionally, some libraries that may be extraneous were left in there due to not fully knowing their functionality and others because they are dependencies needed for some of the other libraries to install.)
4) Run the command "python main.py"
5) Open a browser to localhost:5000
6) Enjoy the application!
